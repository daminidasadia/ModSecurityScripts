# ModSecurityScripts
Collection of ModSecurity 2.9.1 scripts and Apache configurations that protects [a vulnerable web application] (https://github.com/rafaelrpinto/VulnerableJavaWebApplication) from different types of attacks without the need of code changes in the application.

The article I wrote about these scripts is [available on linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fix-without-touching-virtual-patching-web-modsecurity-rafael-pinto).
